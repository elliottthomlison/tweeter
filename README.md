# Tweeter 

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It is the second project that is built during the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp. Tweeter takes in the input of the user and prints it out, resembling Twitter in the process. Tweeter was built in order to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and Ajax front-end skills, along with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB back-end skills. Difficulties arose from inexperience and the use of new tools, the use of a tool to dynamically print the time of each tweet, for example.
